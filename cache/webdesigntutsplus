This year, Webdesigntuts+ is getting involved with a special design review of one of our favorite water-based charities: <a href=\"http://www.charitywater.org/\">charitywater.org</a>. We&#8217;ll explore the key elements that make the website such a success and how you can borrow the same design strategies for your own projects!\n</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-281\"></span></p>\n<hr/ >\n<h2>charity: water</h2>\n<p>\nIn honor of this year&#8217;s Blog Action Day, we&#8217;re offering an in depth design review of the website, <a href=\"http://www.charitywater.org/\">charitywater.org</a>. &#8220;charity: water is a non-profit bringing clean and safe drinking water to people in developing nations&#8221;.\n</p>\n<div class=\"tutorial_image\"><img src=\"http://d3pr5r64n04s3o.cloudfront.net/010_BlogActionDay/1.jpg\" /></div>\n<p>\nSites for charitable organizations are always interesting projects because they need to engage visitors to action. The website far exceeds what you would normally expect from a non-profit though; It boasts solid design fundamentals across the board and has a few great design tricks that give it a sense of character and refinement that few non-profit websites have. Let&#8217;s dig right in!\n</p>\n<hr/ >\n<h2><span>Strategy 01</span>: Color Usage</h2>\n<div class=\"tutorial_image\"><img src=\"http://d3pr5r64n04s3o.cloudfront.net/010_BlogActionDay/2.jpg\" /></div>\n<p>\nThe first thing that you will likely notice on the charity:water website is the disciplined use of their brand color. What&#8217;s unique here is that they use color in the same way that a corporate brand might use color. Notice how the blue never varies from one page to another &#8211; everything from the typographic highlights to the background and infographic colors tie the &#8220;charity: water blue&#8221; back into the design. The color usage is ubiquitous across the site; So even if the layout changes from one page to another, color serves as the constant unifying element&#8230; which ultimately gives the designer a little more freedom to play around with.\n</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8230;using controlled color will create a professional presentation that gives the visitor a feeling that the site is credible and trustworthy.</p></blockquote>\n<p>\nWhat does this controlled color usage do to the aesthetics of the site? It creates a unified, cohesive user experience. More importantly, using consistent color will give the visitor a feeling that the site is credible and trustworthy; something that is vital to non-profits who constantly need to battle for the trust of potential donors.\n</p>\n<hr/ >\n<h2><span>Strategy 02</span>: Smart Typography</h2>\n<div class=\"tutorial_image\"><img src=\"http://d3pr5r64n04s3o.cloudfront.net/010_BlogActionDay/3.jpg\" /></div>\n<p>\nTypography is one of those things that every designer <em>knows</em> deep down is at the heart of engaging visitors, but it&#8217;s so often neglected in favor of the status quo text formatting. The charity:water website excels at using typography to draw the user in and emphasize the key elements that make this specific crisis worth knowing about.\n</p>\n<p>\nFrom a technical standpoint, the typography uses established principles to guide the eyes around: the navigation and brand are subdued but easy to locate; &#8220;calls to action&#8221; and other key pieces of information are bold and easy to scan. Within 10 seconds of visiting the site, you probably had a pretty good grasp of the message just by scanning the major headlines&#8230; that&#8217;s effective typography! Instead of burying major points of interest within blocks of paragraph text, the site brings them to the front of the visitor&#8217;s attention.\n</p>\n<blockquote><p>Within 10 seconds of visiting the site, you probably had a pretty good grasp of the message just by scanning the major headlines&#8230; that&#8217;s effective typography!</p></blockquote>\n<p>\nWhile the typography across the site feels wild and innovative on the face, it never breaks from a core set of rules: major headlines are set in a block typeface that draws instant attention, titles are set in a serif typeface that feels dignified, and the rest of the text on the page is set in a simple sans-serif that is easy to read. Using just a few simple rules like this can help unify your design even if you want to be all over the board with your layouts and type usage.  Let&#8217;s take a quick peek at the type hierarchy on the site:\n</p>\n<h4>Type Hierarchy on charity: water</h4>\n<div class=\"tutorial_image\"><img src=\"http://d3pr5r64n04s3o.cloudfront.net/010_BlogActionDay/8.jpg\" /></div>\n<h4>A Rebuttal Worth Noting:</h4>\n<p>\nI should mention one thing that charity:water does that isn&#8217;t quite perfect from a technical point of view. If you browse the site enough, you&#8217;ll notice little places here and there that they break their own rules. For instance, in some places, paragraph text is serif, where on the bulk of the site it&#8217;s sans-serif. The result is a slight break in the cohesiveness of the site&#8230; these inconsistencies are minor on this site, but it&#8217;s important to keep in mind that if your own design is feeling &#8220;scatterbrained&#8221;, it&#8217;s worth taking the time to go through each and every type-style to reduce the variety of styles that you have in use.\n</p>\n<hr/ >\n<h2><span>Strategy 03</span>: Using InfoGraphics</h2>\n<div class=\"tutorial_image\"><img src=\"http://d3pr5r64n04s3o.cloudfront.net/010_BlogActionDay/4.jpg\" /></div>\n<p>\nI&#8217;ll keep this explanation short and sweet: if you have information that&#8217;s best represented as a graphic, show it as a graphic! People are visual-thinkers, don&#8217;t beat around the bush by trying to explain something with words that is easier described with a visual.\n</p>\n<hr/ >\n<h2><span>Strategy 04</span>: Coupling Image with Text</h2>\n<div class=\"tutorial_image\"><img src=\"http://d3pr5r64n04s3o.cloudfront.net/010_BlogActionDay/5.jpg\" /></div>\n<p>\nThis is similar to the third strategy, but it&#8217;s warrants it&#8217;s own brief explanation. Often, you&#8217;ll be trying to design a page for content that&#8217;s so complex, so academic, so data-driven that using just text or an infographic alone won&#8217;t deliver the message effectively. In these cases, it&#8217;s worth considering how you might pair an image with text. The text is still where the raw information will be, but the image will act as a &#8220;softener&#8221;, making the information appear simpler than it really is &#8211; which encourages people to actually read it!\n</p>\n<hr/ >\n<h2><span>Strategy 05</span>: Unique Layouts</h2>\n<div class=\"tutorial_image\"><img src=\"http://d3pr5r64n04s3o.cloudfront.net/010_BlogActionDay/6.jpg\" /></div>\n<p>\nIt&#8217;s the &#8220;One Trick Pony&#8221; of web design; The organizational paradigm that you see when you visit most sites is this: 1 custom designed homepage, 1 call-to-action page, and <em>1 template for everything else</em>. The notion of using just one template to handle the majority of a site&#8217;s content is shortsighted though! Using just one template bores visitors once they leave the homepage&#8230; instead of continuing that motivational high, these &#8220;one size fits all&#8221; templates invite users to leave the site once they feel like they&#8217;ve gotten the main idea.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhere charity:water succeeds is that they use a wide variety of layouts across their entire site. The result: content feels <em>fresh </em>on every page. Visitors are encouraged to keep on clicking around the site just to see what lies around the next corner. Even better, the design of each page actually matches the content on that page (crazy idea huh?). While developing a wide variety of unique page templates might cost a bit extra, the net effect is that the site actually engages visitors and is more likely to succeed at getting visitors involved.\n</p>\n<h4>Another Rebuttal&#8230;</h4>\n<p>\nIt&#8217;s important to note that using a variety of layouts isn&#8217;t always the right solution. In the case of charity:water, it works because the site has a large enough diversity of content that it actually makes sense to give each type of content it&#8217;s own layout. In other sites though, using radically different layouts from one page to the next can break the continuity in a design and actually work as a detriment to the site experience.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s no hard rule for deciding when a custom page template is warranted though, so you&#8217;ll just have to use your own instincts. When in doubt, use a generic page template &#8211; if the generic template hinders the content more than it helps it, consider creating a custom layout. If you do decide a custom page template is necessary, take care to keep the vital information (brand, navigation, account info, shopping cart, etc.) in the same place on each and every page.\n</p>\n<hr/ >\n<h2><span>Strategy 06</span>: Make the Ordinary Look Fun</h2>\n<div class=\"tutorial_image\"><img src=\"http://d3pr5r64n04s3o.cloudfront.net/010_BlogActionDay/7.jpg\" /></div>\n<p>\nLet&#8217;s face it: if you&#8217;re working on a non-profit website, there&#8217;s going to be a lot of dull informational pages that, while important, won&#8217;t ooze inspiration. What charity:water has done with these information pages is display them in unique grid layout. By using icons and images along with the informational blurbs, the visitor&#8217;s are encouraged to look around and find something of interest to them. More importantly, it makes these otherwise ordinary pages look &#8220;fun&#8221;, which delivers a subtle message to visitors that even the most dull parts of this organization&#8217;s operation are executed with creativity and passion.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe takeaway here is simple: don&#8217;t ignore the ordinary content pages! While these pages might feel unimportant, there is a unique opportunity to surprise visitors by creating intelligent approaches to displaying this kind of content.\n</p>\n<hr/ >\n<h2>Concluding Remarks</h2>\n<p>I like the charity:water website&#8230; I really do. Each page feels fresh and it actually makes me want to get involved. Some might say that this is the sign of a genuine cause &#8211; a crisis so important that people are simply drawn to participate. I&#8217;m going to go out on a limb though and say that the effectiveness of the site has as much to do with the design as it does the content. Sure, if the cause were &#8220;donate $5 to Steve Jobs&#8221;, I wouldn&#8217;t really care about it regardless of how well designed the site was (some might disagree with this, haha!), but this is one of those wonderful times where design truly can make the world a better place. </p>\n<p>Thanks for reading this year&#8217;s Blog Action Day post!

Your web site’s design should enhance your site&#8217;s purpose by putting the focus on the content and being usable by everyone. Taking the extra time to ensure no detail is left overlooked will produce an effective and attractive website.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-8\"></span></p>\n<p>Curt Ziegler (aka <a href=\"http://cudazi.com/\">cudazi</a>) is a web designer specializing in WordPress theme development with 10 years of design experience, a number of highly successful products and over 5000 sales at <a href=\"http://themeforest.net/user/cudazi\">ThemeForest</a>! Read on to get some professional tips and tricks exclusively from Curt:</p>\n<hr />\n<p>\n<h2>Define the Site&#8217;s Purpose</h2>\n<blockquote><p>Your site needs a clearly defined purpose to eliminate any confusion from the start&#8230;</p></blockquote>\n<p>First things first &#8211; before opening up your favorite graphics app to design your hot new minimal site, you will need to establish what the site is going to be used for. Your site needs a clearly defined purpose to eliminate any confusion from the start by having a single, strong focal point. It may be to display award winning photographs to potential clients, share breaking technology news or used to sell your hand made pet toys. Start by making a simple statement:</p>\n<p>My site needs to ______________________________________.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Educate teens on the dangers of texting and driving</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Showcase award winning photos to potential clients</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Sell hand-made, premium dog toys</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By clearly defining a purpose early on, you will be able to use it to help keep your design on track. As you work through the design elements, continue to ask yourself questions such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Will this compliment and reinforce my site&#8217;s purpose?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Is this really needed or am I just filling space?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Will this be distracting from my site&#8217;s purpose?</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Anything you add to the site that does not reinforce your site&#8217;s true purpose can be a distraction, weakening your overall message. The additional items must compliment your focus. </p>\n<p>Your site selling high-performance pogo sticks does not need to include a link to your stock photography portfolio, no matter just how awesome it is.</p>\n<p>This isn&#8217;t the time for things you want on your site, it&#8217;s what is needed that is truly important. You only have a few seconds to convince your visitors to stick around and read your message.</p>\n</p>\n<hr />\n<p>\n<h2>Sweat the Little Things</h2>\n<p>Every detail has significance, what you remove from your design is equally as important as what you add.</p>\n<p>The fundamentals are just that, fundamental. All your design principals become much more important to understand and implement when clutter and unneeded items are removed, pushing your message to the forefront.</p>\n<p>Mistakes are magnified with clean, simple, minimal designs. Ensuring you have studied the design fundamentals is vital when it comes to placing items on the page and relating them to one another. Everything you do needs planning and purpose &#8211; just because there is room for &#8220;one more thing&#8221; doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean there needs to be something there. </p>\n<p>Many if not all of the design principles apply to clean, simple, minimal style designs but be sure to get these down from the beginning:</p>\n<h4>Unity</h4>\n<p>Your page elements need to get along and fit well together to improve the overall design. Items that stand out to grab attention on the page need to stand out because you want them to, not because they don’t mesh with the other items on the page.</p>\n<p>\n<div class=\"tutorial_image\"><img src=\"http://d3pr5r64n04s3o.cloudfront.net/003_LessIsMore/1.jpg\"></p>\n<p>\t\tSimple splashes of color add interest to a black and white color scheme and draw your eye from the logo right into creative, clever and fun.</div>\n</p>\n<h4>Whitespace</h4>\n<p>Elements on the page need room to breathe. It may seem logical to you and you may be doing it without even thinking but common requests from clients seem to be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>“Let’s add one more thing, there seems to be a lot of extra space here&#8230;” </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>“There is room under the menu, move it up so we can add&#8230;”</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>“There is a gap along the sides of the site, we should also include&#8230;.”</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By giving up valuable whitespace between elements, the site becomes cramped and elements begin to run together, not giving your eyes a needed break which help to define separate areas.</p>\n<p>\n<div class=\"tutorial_image\"><img src=\"http://d3pr5r64n04s3o.cloudfront.net/003_LessIsMore/2.jpg\"></p>\n<p>\t\tWeb Creme has a limited number of ads but places them in an area with greatest impact.</div>\n</p>\n<h4>Alignment</h4>\n<p>There are many ways to align objects on a page but with a clean, simple, minimal design, if something is even a pixel or two off it will be much easier to spot.</p>\n<p>Use a grid to keep everything you need aligned, squared away and perfect. They’re great from sketching out a design all the way to development with many frameworks to choose from.</p>\n<p>\n<div class=\"tutorial_image\"><img src=\"http://d3pr5r64n04s3o.cloudfront.net/003_LessIsMore/3.jpg\"></p>\n<p>\t\tSubtlety not your thing? Create an immediate impact by choosing a bold color to compliment your design.</div>\n</p>\n<h4>Hierarchy</h4>\n<p>With many sites, you only have a few seconds to convey your message or help lead a user where you want them to go.</p>\n<p>The way you use different sizes and weights of elements creates a path, leading the user through the page, typically ending up in a call to action area. When users feel comfortable they are heading in the right direction, they will continue on, but if confused as to what is going on, they may become frustrated.</p>\n<p>\n<div class=\"tutorial_image\"><img src=\"http://d3pr5r64n04s3o.cloudfront.net/003_LessIsMore/4.jpg\"></p>\n<p>\t\tPandaweb uses whitespace to keep visitors’ attention on the promotional area.</div>\n</p>\n<hr />\n<p>\n<h2>Remove the Unnecessary</h2>\n<p>What is the best way to find and eliminate unnecessary elements? By not adding them in the first place! Spend extra time planning out the site and defining your purpose early on to eliminate extras that were just filling up space.</p>\n<p>During the design process, spend ample time going through each element of your site asking &#8211; do I really  need this? Your purpose or focus may shift slightly along the way so it’s a good idea to keep asking yourself this as you move along.</p>\n<p>If you have access to a test group, try using click tracking software on a test site to locate elements that are never used. Look at the unused elements and decide whether you can remove them or place them in a different location.</p>\n<p>Remember, creating a clean, simple, minimal design allows the mind to get down to the basics, shows your visitors what you have to offer and get your message across in the most efficient way possible.</p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<h3>Usability is Not Optional</h3>\n<p>There&#8217;s no good reason to choose design over usability, they will work together perfectly if executed properly. A well designed, easy to use site will keep visitors around longer and fulfill the site&#8217;s ultimate purpose of displaying your content and delivering your message effectively.</p>\n<p>A site that is easy and comfortable to use will almost feel as if it is reading the user’s mind and browsing becomes easy and fun.</p>\n<p>Don’t be afraid to be creative with new styles and techniques but be conscious of common functionality and placement of elements that you may take for granted:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Links should be easy to identify and click on</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Always provide a way to go home</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Never disable the back button</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Add close buttons to content in pop-up windows</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Indicate what page the user is currently on</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some people associate clean, simple, minimal designs with miniature text and almost unusable elements on an empty page. Some of the most basic guidelines are commonly overlooked when designing new sites:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The navigation should be consistent and intuitive to use</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The content should be readable with clearly defined headings</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The code should be clean and comply with the latest web standards</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Ensure your site displays and functions properly on all browsers</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Locating Trouble Spots</h4>\n<p>While some things look great in the design phase, once you get the site in your browser, you may uncover usability challenges you never noticed while the design was in Photoshop.</p>\n<p>A great way to actually find out how the site is used is by grabbing a volunteer and looking over their shoulder or (with their permission) use a desktop sharing tool if you’re not in the same physical location.</p>\n<p>Give them a list of tasks and watch closely to see if they’re easily accomplished:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Purchase a book from my store</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Contact me for an appointment</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Find out about my background</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You may be amazed how different people may interpret different areas of the site or the paths they may take. Watch them closely but don’t give any help or tips along the way.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Will they know where to click? </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Do they get lost on a specific area? </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Are they clicking on a design element thinking it will bring them to a new page? </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Do they have a hard time clicking on a tiny icon?</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Take notes on areas they may struggle on and find ways to improve. Do not get defensive or angry if problems are found with the site. Use that new knowledge to improve your work and carry that knowledge onto future projects.</p>\n</p>\n<hr />\n<p>\n<h2>But I Like Color!</h2>\n<p>Creating a clean, simple, minimal design does not mean you need to be stuck in black &#038; white or with a drab and uninteresting site, just learn to simplify your color choices. There are two main routes to take when adding color:</p>\n<h4>Color Splash</h4>\n<p>With small pops of color, your visitors&#8217; eyes will immediately know that the area with color is important. Use this to your advantage by using it to paint a path for the eyes to follow.</p>\n<p>\n<div class=\"tutorial_image\"><img src=\"http://d3pr5r64n04s3o.cloudfront.net/003_LessIsMore/5.jpg\"></p>\n<p>\t\tCSS Frameworks such as the 960.gs system provide a way to keep everything aligned perfectly.</div>\n</p>\n<h4>Simple Yet Bold</h4>\n<p>A more daring choice may be to make your color statement in the background with a bold solid color. Bold can be distracting so make sure you are not taking away from the message of your site, making it hard to read or unusable but this will definitely get your site noticed.</p>\n<p>\n<div class=\"tutorial_image\"><img src=\"http://d3pr5r64n04s3o.cloudfront.net/003_LessIsMore/6.jpg\"></p>\n<p>\t\tThe elements of Finch feel as if they all belong on the page and work together.</div>\n</p>\n<hr />\n<p>\n<h2>It&#8217;s Not for Everyone </h2>\n<p>Nearly anyone will benefit from a site with a strong focus but a clean, simple, minimal style is not for everyone.</p>\n<p><strong>Website Theme Authors</strong> &#8211; Often times you only get a few seconds before a buyer will decide on whether they want to spend time looking at the site you created. Displaying only a super minimal design as the only layout option may register as “basic” and be thought of immediately as lacking in features. You may just need to show various levels of what&#8217;s possible in areas and let them decide whether to use the feature or not.</p>\n<p><strong>Ad Heavy Sites</strong> &#8211; The clean, simple, minimal style will probably not the best fit for sites that rely heavily on advertising unless you have very understanding ad-owners that adapt to fit your style. A better option may be to place fewer ads but locate them in an area that would be clicked on the most. </p>\n<p>\n<div class=\"tutorial_image\"><img src=\"http://d3pr5r64n04s3o.cloudfront.net/003_LessIsMore/7.jpg\"></p>\n<p>\t\tSofa uses an inverted pyramid of information leading you down the lage from the heading, company overview and into the services they provide.</div>\n</p>\n<hr />\n<p>\n<h2>Finding a Balance</h2>\n<p>Realizing we don&#8217;t all get full creative control of every design project, try and find a balance with your clients. </p>\n<p>When explaining why you designed a site in a certain way, refer to other sites that do things correctly and explain why it works and why their website is a success. </p>\n<p>Explain how they benefited and how you could too. Show them the positive results and responses the other site has received because of the good design choices and taking the extra time to ensure all visitors have a usable, effective site.</p></p>\n","commentRss":"http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/design-theory/less-is-more-fundamentals-of-minimalist-web-design/feed/"},{"title":"Understanding Visual Hierarchy in Web Design","link":"http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/design-theory/understanding-visual-hierarchy-in-web-design/","comments":["http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/design-theory/understanding-visual-hierarchy-in-web-design/#comments","54"],"pubDate":"Wed, 13 Oct 2010 22:51:49 +0000","creator":"Brandon Jones","category":["Design Theory","alignment","color","contrast","hierarchy","proximity","repetition","size","texture","visual"],"guid":{"isPermaLink":"false","content":"http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/?p=84"},"description":"<p>Visual hierarchy is one of the most important principles behind effective web design. This article will examine why developing a visual hierarchy is crucial on the web, the theory behind it, and how you can use some very basic exercises in your own designs to put these principles into practice.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-84\"></span></p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Design = Communication</h2>\n<p>At it&#8217;s core, design is all about visual communication: To be an effective designer, you have to be able to clearly communicate your ideas to viewers or else lose their attention. People are fickle though; if you give them a massive block of information, chances are that 99 out of 100 people won&#8217;t bother to read it. Why? Because most people are inherently visual thinkers, not data processors.</p>\n<p>To figure out why this is true, it&#8217;s important to understand a little bit about the way that we see things. People aren&#8217;t what you would call &#8220;equal opportunity see-ers&#8221;. Rather than taking in visual information and processing it evenly, people organize what they see in terms of &#8220;visual relationships&#8221;. Let us consider the following image of two ordinary circles:</p>\n<div class=\"tutorial_image\"><img src=\"http://d3pr5r64n04s3o.cloudfront.net/006_Hierarchy/1.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></div>\n<p>Chances are, you don&#8217;t see &#8220;two circles&#8221;; Instead, you saw &#8220;one black circle and one smaller red circle&#8221;.</p>\n<p>The reason is pretty simple: When presented with something as simple as two circles, a person won&#8217;t just see two ordinary circles, they will find a way to <em>differentiate </em>between the two. One circle might be bigger, or smaller, or colored, or any other variety of differences. These differences allow us to distinguish between objects and give them unique meanings.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s now look at a more complex image:</p>\n<div class=\"tutorial_image\"><img src=\"http://d3pr5r64n04s3o.cloudfront.net/006_Hierarchy/3.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></div>\n<p>The added complexity actually re-enforces our desire to &#8220;classify&#8221; the objects in terms of relationships. Similarities and differences become the frame that we view the shapes through. Differences in scale suggest that one object is closer to us than another or that one is more dominant than the other; Variations in color might suggest that one object holds a unique personality that sets it apart from the other object. A lot of information can be delivered in just a single image by using some very rudimentary tools.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8230;Understanding that people will see our designs in terms of relationships is crucial to becoming a more effective designer.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Let&#8217;s take this example back to web design; Because web design is all about communicating visual information, understanding that people will see our designs in terms of relationships is crucial to becoming a more effective designer. While it might seem like it&#8217;s enough to just dish out information, as web designers, our task is to break down that raw information into delicious little chunks of visually relevant information that are easy on the eyes, and more importantly, effective at communicating the message behind a webpage.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>The Dawn of Hierarchy</h2>\n<p>There are a hundred explanations for why people see in terms of relationships; If you were to trace it back anthropologically, you might conclude that a hunter-gatherer mentality forced humans at one point to recognize that seeing relationships is a survival skill.</p>\n<div class=\"tutorial_image\"><img src=\"http://d3pr5r64n04s3o.cloudfront.net/006_Hierarchy/4.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><br />\nSee, even prehistoric man had a healthy respect for visual contrast.</div>\n<p>Perhaps a more practical explanation is that it&#8217;s simply the way that our brains categorize information: grouping similar visual elements and organizing it into meaningful patterns is as inherent to our human nature as eating or drinking. Either way, the fact is that even in it&#8217;s most basic form, information that is organized with a hierarchy in mind will always be more effective at communicating than unorganized information.</p>\n<p>Consider the following image of two text blocks:</p>\n<div class=\"tutorial_image\"><img src=\"http://d3pr5r64n04s3o.cloudfront.net/006_Hierarchy/2.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></div>\n<p>In the example above, we see the most rudimentary form of a visual hierarchy system applied to text. The information in each of the two examples isn&#8217;t any different, but how it&#8217;s been broken up dramatically changes the way that reader&#8217;s will see it and take it in. When we talk about visual hierarchy in terms of typography, this is what we mean. The proximity, scale, and similarity of the text formatting allows a reader to organize the lower example into titles and paragrahs. The hierarchy gives the titles more meaning than the other information, and makes it easier to scan.</p>\n<p>\nAlright, so this is all pretty basic stuff, right? Let&#8217;s take a dive into some deeper examples of how you can apply this very <em>basic</em> principle to some very <em>sophisticated</em> designs:</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>The Hierarchists Toolbox</h2>\n<p>Understanding that visual hierarchy is important is all fine and well, but how does a designer actually create it? The &#8220;tools&#8221; that we&#8217;ll look at are as simple as a carpenter&#8217;s toolset &#8211; hammer, nail, saw, etc &#8211; It&#8217;s what you do with them is what counts!</p>\n<h3>Size</h3>\n<p>Objects that are bigger demand more attention. Using size as a hierarchal tool is an effective way of guiding a viewer&#8217;s eye to a particular portion of the page. Because size is one of the most powerful forms of organization, it&#8217;s important to correlate <em>size </em>with <em>importance </em>in a design. The biggest elements should be the most important in most cases; the smallest elements should be the least important.</p>\n<div class=\"tutorial_image\"><a href=\"http://getactive.sj-stmk.org/\"><img src=\"http://d3pr5r64n04s3o.cloudfront.net/006_Hierarchy/5.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><br />\nThe use of BIG, bold type adds a level of order to this otherwise chaotic design. The eye should naturally move from big elements down to the smaller elements.</div>\n<hr />\n<h3>Color</h3>\n<p>Color is an interesting tool because it can function as both an organizational tool as well as a personality tool. Bold, contrasting colors on a particular element of a website will demand attention (such as with buttons or error messages or hyperlinks). When used as a <em>personality </em>tool, color can extend beyond into more sophisticated types of hierarchy; Using lush, comforting colors can bring an emotional appeal to a page. Color can affect everything from a websites brand (ie: CocaCola Red) to symbolism (ie: cool, subdued colors). Advanced applications of color can even be used to &#8220;classify&#8221; information within a hierarchy, as in the following example:</p>\n<div class=\"tutorial_image\"><a href=\"http://msnbcmedia.msn.com/i/msnbc/components/spectra/index.html\"><img src=\"http://d3pr5r64n04s3o.cloudfront.net/006_Hierarchy/6.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><br />\nThe Spectra Viewer site uses colors to represent different news categories, so it&#8217;s easy to find a particular type of information based on the color key.</div>\n<hr />\n<h3>Contrast</h3>\n<p>Contrast shows relative important. Dramatic shifts in text-size or color will impart a message that something is different and requires attention. Changing from a light background color to a dark background color can quickly separate the core content of a page from the footer.</p>\n<div class=\"tutorial_image\"><a href=\"http://www.arvorecer.com.br/\"><img src=\"http://d3pr5r64n04s3o.cloudfront.net/006_Hierarchy/7.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><br />\nThe contrast between the light, airy header section and dark, earthy footer creates a distinct hierarchy of information.</div>\n<hr />\n<h3>Alignment</h3>\n<p>Alignment creates order between elements. It can be as simple as the difference between a &#8220;content column&#8221; and a &#8220;sidebar column&#8221;, but alignment can also take on more complex hierarchical roles. Consider, for instance, the power of information placed in the top-right of a web page. Because users general expect information in that part of the screen to be associated with profiles, accounts, shopping carts, etc., it gives everything places in that area a sense of the &#8220;official&#8221;. Alignment can also provoke interest if used in unique ways, such as in the following examples:</p>\n<div class=\"tutorial_image\"><a href=\"http://themeforest.net/item/stuff-template/full_screen_preview/127580\"><img src=\"http://d3pr5r64n04s3o.cloudfront.net/006_Hierarchy/8.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><br />\nThe Stuff Template uses a unique horizontal alignment system to separate brand and navigation from blog post content.</div>\n<div class=\"tutorial_image\"><a href=\"http://themeforest.net/item/flex-for-wordpress-a-portfolio-blog-theme/full_screen_preview/93825\"><img src=\"http://d3pr5r64n04s3o.cloudfront.net/006_Hierarchy/7b.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><br />\nThe Flex Template uses a grid inspired layout to develop visually interest as well as a taxonomy driven visual hierarchy.</div>\n<hr />\n<h3>Repetition</h3>\n<p>Repetition assigns relative meaning to elements; If all &#8220;paragraph&#8221; text is grey, when a user sees a new block of grey text, he can assume it&#8217;s another basic paragraph; when that same user encounters a blue link or a black title, he can safely assume it is different and unique from the grey text.</p>\n<div class=\"tutorial_image\"><a href=\"http://virgin.com/\"><img src=\"http://d3pr5r64n04s3o.cloudfront.net/006_Hierarchy/9.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><br />\nThe Virgin site creates repetitive elements like paragraph text, then breaks the repetition when it wants to draw attention (like the red quote text).</div>\n<hr />\n<h3>Proximity</h3>\n<p>Proximity separates elements from each other and creates sub-hierarchies. Within a page there might be widgets that are separated from each other by space; within those widgets there is a new hierarchy of title, subtitle, and content. Proximity is also the quickest way to associate similar content. In the following example, it&#8217;s easy to find certain types of content simply based on their proximity with each other.</p>\n<div class=\"tutorial_image\"><a href=\"http://net.tutsplus.com/\"><img src=\"http://d3pr5r64n04s3o.cloudfront.net/006_Hierarchy/10.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><br />\nThe Tuts+ sites actually do this really well (not to toot our own horn!). The left &#8220;content&#8221; column is clearly separated in proximity from the sidebar widget space. Furthermore, meta-data within a particular blog post is placed in close proximity of that post and further from other posts, reinforcing a sense of &#8220;belonging&#8221;.</div>\n<hr />\n<h3>Density and Whitespace</h3>\n<p>Densely packing elements into a space makes it feel &#8220;heavy&#8221; and cluttered; When elements are spaced out too much, they may lose the relationships to one another. When a page is designed &#8220;just right&#8221;, the eye will easily recognize when elements are related and when they aren&#8217;t.</p>\n<div class=\"tutorial_image\"><a href=\"http://www.pojeta.cz/\"><img src=\"http://d3pr5r64n04s3o.cloudfront.net/006_Hierarchy/11.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><br />\nBy spacing elements out and keeping plenty of whitespace on the page, this design makes it easier for people to roam around and find the small, densely packed boxes of content.</div>\n<hr />\n<h3>Style and Texture</h3>\n<p>Perhaps the most open-ended tool in the Hierarchists Toolbox, style can be used to impart a form of hierarchy that both embraces and transcends the other tools. For instance: a flat gray background will &#8220;feel&#8221; different than an asphalt textured background.This style or personality given by the designer will naturally play a role in how different visual relationships are made.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s worth mentioning that style is also one of the most dangerous tools that a designer can use. Just like a carpenter cutting his finger off on a band-saw, a designer can easily mislead people by overemphasizing certain elements through style. Imagine a heavily textured, heavily designed site element that demands so much attention that it distracts instead of informing. This same idea extends to typefaces, buttons, tabs, and other elements. Be considerate of the impact on an overall design when you choose to add extra style and polish to an element.</p>\n<div class=\"tutorial_image\"><a href=\"http://www.jefffinley.org/\"><img src=\"http://d3pr5r64n04s3o.cloudfront.net/006_Hierarchy/12.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><br />\nJeff Finley&#8217;s site does a great job of combining a lot of the tools that we discussed here, but his use of originally styled elements over the standard UI fodder are what gives the entire design sense of intentional hierarchy. Jeff manages to add just enough style to make his site feel personal without it going overboard.</div>\n<hr />\n<h2>Failed Hierarchy</h2>\n<blockquote><p>Good visual hierarchy isn&#8217;t about wild and crazy graphics or the newest photoshop filters, it&#8217;s about organizing information in a way that&#8217;s usable, accessible, and logical to the everyday site visitor.</p></blockquote>\n<p>\nAs I just suggested in the last section, it&#8217;s important to note that hierarchy can be used for both good and evil. Think of all the annoying Flash advertisements, popup windows, glitter banners, etc. that the web has been plagued with over the years! While these ads succeed in grabbing attention, they ultimately fail the site owner and the viewer by breaking the visual hierarchy within a site. Similarly, if a designer builds a visual hierarchy such that certain key pieces of information are nearly impossible to find, the designer will have failed at his task. Good visual hierarchy isn&#8217;t about wild and crazy graphics or the newest photoshop filters, it&#8217;s about organizing information in a way that&#8217;s usable, accessible, and logical to the everyday site visitor.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Why Hierarchy is Especially Relevant to Web Designers</h2>\n<blockquote><p>“Designers can create normalcy out of chaos; they can clearly communicate ideas through the organizing and manipulating of words and pictures.”—Jeffery Veen, The Art and Science of Web Design</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Jeffrey Veen wrote those words in 2001, but they still hold a heckuva lot of power today where &#8220;information overload&#8221; seems to be commonplace. As people, we&#8217;ve always had a keen sense for visual organization. However, as a society we&#8217;ve been being barraged with a vertiable tsunami of visual information over the last couple decades; as a result, people nowadays are hyper-sensitive to visual hierarchy. This is especially the case on the web where studies have proven that regular web surfers have learned to &#8220;scan&#8221; content innately; automatically seeking information that is relevant to their interests and discarding/disregarding information that doesn&#8217;t.</p>\n<p>Because of this, becoming a master of visual hierarchy isn&#8217;t optional, it&#8217;s mandatory. As the typical web-surfing platforms expand from the traditional monitor to phones, tablets, even televisions, it&#8217;s becoming ever more important that we use strong, clear visual systems to communicate with web surfers.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>An Exercise to Test Visual Hierarchy</h2>\n<p>\nTo conclude, I&#8217;d like to end with a very simple exercise. As the example, we&#8217;ll use a website that you frequent, or a project that you&#8217;ve worked on recently; The exercise goes like this:\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>List the key information points that visitors are likely seeking.</li>\n<li>Assign values (1-10) according to their importance to the average visitor.</li>\n<li>Now, look at the actual design again.</li>\n<li>Assign values (1-10) according to the <em>actual</em> visual importance as you see it in the live design.</li>\n<li>Consider: Does the expected importance match up with the actual designed importance?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\nIn most cases, the answer will include shades of &#8220;no&#8221;. There are lots of reasons for this &#8211; client demands, inexperienced designers, design-by-committee &#8211; or a hundred other reasons that you&#8217;ve probably read. Heck, in some cases, the designer may want to mislead the viewer (consider a &#8220;free&#8221; site that&#8217;s trying to guide users to paid content). Whatever the reason, understanding visual hierarchy and trying to interpret it is a way to improve the way that you see web design in a whole new light. Hopefully it&#8217;ll help inform your own work as well!</p>\n","commentRss":"http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/design-theory/understanding-visual-hierarchy-in-web-design/feed/"},{"title":"Envato ‘WordPress Pack’ Bundle!","link":"http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/news/envato-wordpress-pack-bundle/","comments":["http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/news/envato-wordpress-pack-bundle/#comments","8"],"pubDate":"Wed, 13 Oct 2010 01:07:53 +0000","creator":"collis","category":"News","guid":{"isPermaLink":"false","content":"http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/?p=318"},"description":"<p>Love WordPress?

People devote years of their lives to this ancient craft, and yet there&apos;s always something new to learn. In this article, I&#8217;ll be reviewing the major points that you should consider when selecting a typeface for a website.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-15\"></span></p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Practical Typography</h2>\n<p>When you design for the web, you have to accept that the content will change. It&apos;s simply out of the question to take the time to kern (adjust space between individual letters) each title on a huge website. In other words, you give up some control.</p>\n<p>What I&apos;m going to be focusing on today is <em>practical typography</em>. For me, this means accepting that you will never have total control over the type on your websites. Choosing a typeface, deciding on a size, these are all things we as designers have a say in. Practical typography means learning how, and more importantly why, to adjust what you do have control over. Let&apos;s get started.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Readability</h2>\n<p>What do you do with type? Read it! So why do so many websites make it so damned difficult to do just that? Be it tiny font sizes, crammed line-height, or just plain ugly fonts, it seems that a lot of sites out there are determined to not let you enjoy their content!</p>\n<p>By making your type readable, you immediately jump ahead of at least half of the competition, which is fortunate, really, because it&apos;s not that hard!</p>\n<h3>Typefaces</h3>\n<p>When deciding what typeface to use on your website, it&apos;s important to remember: <em>don&apos;t over think it</em>. I know that many designers hate using Helvetica, because it is wildly overused. I agree with this, but there&apos;s one very important piece of information this statement leaves out: why. People overuse Helvetica because it&apos;s just <em>so damn good</em>. It fits right in with virtually every design imaginable, it works well in small, as well as huge sizes.</p>\n<p>While it may go against your beliefs to set your type in such an abused face, if it works, then go for it.</p>\n<p>Your body copy is arguably the part of your design that needs to be most readable, so make sure you pick a font that works well in small sizes. What do I mean by that? If you can set your copy to 10px and you can still make out what it says, then that&apos;s a good indication you&apos;ve chosen a readable typeface.</p>\n<p>That covers body copy, but what about titles?</p>\n<p>Readability in large titles is far easier to figure out than in body copy. If you can make out what it says immediately, then it&apos;s readable enough.</p>\n<p>What&apos;s good about typefaces is that once you&apos;ve worked on enough projects, you&apos;ll have a good idea of what works and what doesn&apos;t. From there, you&apos;ll be in a better position to make critical choices about fonts.</p>\n<p>There&apos;s no formula for choosing the right fonts for your website. Often, the best way to decide on one is to just try out each font you think might work, and then compare. Choosing fonts is really a gut instinct, but it&apos;s important to remember that 90% of the time, a user won&apos;t be thinking about what font is used, so if it&apos;s readable, then that&apos;s often good enough.</p>\n<div class=\"tutorial_image\"><img src=\"http://d3pr5r64n04s3o.cloudfront.net/001_FontSelection/1.jpg\" /></div>\n<h3>Pairing</h3>\n<p>There&apos;s rarely (if ever) a situation where <em>just one</em> typeface is appropriate for use on a site. The average website has a lot of text. There&apos;s no way one typeface will work for all of them! The vast majority of well-designed websites use two typefaces: one for body copy, and one for headlines.</p>\n<p>When choosing a pair of fonts, the most important thing to consider is how they work together. &ldquo;Are they similar enough?&rdquo; &ldquo;Too similar?&rdquo; &ldquo;Not different enough?&rdquo; All these are questions you should be asking yourself. I find that the best way to choose a pair of fonts that works is to just put a lot of them side by side and decide on the best. There&apos;s no way to know which is the best until you&apos;ve tried all of them.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, the most appropriate thing would be two sans-serifs, while other times, you want a sans for headlines, and a serif for body copy. It doesn&apos;t particularly matter if they look similar, what matters is if they <em>act similar</em>. This of course depends on the rest of your design. Whichever fonts you choose has to convey your message strongly, and if that means having contrasting typefaces, then go for it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://colly.com\">Simon Collison</a> uses font pairing excellently on his site, choosing a strong sans-serif for main titles, and a simple Serif for the other, smaller headlines, as well as copy. This partnership expertly displays the message that the website is trying to say, in a way that each font individually could not express.</p>\n<div class=\"tutorial_image\"><img src=\"http://d3pr5r64n04s3o.cloudfront.net/001_FontSelection/2.jpg\" /></div>\n<h3>Size</h3>\n<p>As a general rule, designers like to set their body copy at the very least at 12px. Most, however, chose a larger size like 14px, which is even better for readability. Font-sizing is really quite easy to decide on for body copy, but it&apos;s the titles that start to get complicated.</p>\n<p>How big should your titles be? It depends. In my observation and creation of websites, I&apos;ve come to the conclusion that a title should only be as big as it needs to be. This means that you should try out different sizes until you find one that is just big enough to draw the attention you want to it, but no bigger, unless huge text is what you&apos;re going for, in which case go right on ahead.</p>\n<div class=\"tutorial_image\"><img src=\"http://d3pr5r64n04s3o.cloudfront.net/001_FontSelection/3.jpg\" /></div>\n<h3>Hierarchy</h3>\n<p>The nature of a title is big. It&apos;s an important item on the page, so naturally it should be bigger, right? Yes and no. Yes, titles are generally bigger than other elements, but no, this is not the only way to draw attention to them. Color, weight, and placement are all equally important to establishing a clear <em>visual hierarchy</em> to your pages.</p>\n<p>The key point to remember about visual hierarchy is that it&apos;s all relative. Text on your site only has to stand out compared to the other text on your site. Take <a href=\"http://www.wilsonminer.com/\">Wilson Miner&apos;s site</a> for example. His titles are quite small for how important they are, and are surprisingly close in size. However, his use of color distinguishes the most important title, and gives them more meaning.</p>\n<div class=\"tutorial_image\"><img src=\"http://d3pr5r64n04s3o.cloudfront.net/001_FontSelection/4.jpg\" /></div>\n<p>The use of type is a very important tool to establishing visual hierarchy, be it through size, color, weight, or even placement.</p>\n<h3>Leading</h3>\n<p>Leading, or the space between lines of text, is an invaluable tool for readable text. Bad leading can ruin an otherwise stellar piece of copy, and good leading can make even the worst type look readable. Fortunately, it&apos;s not that complicated to implement.</p>\n<p>Using the CSS <em>line-height</em> property, you can easily assign space between your lines of copy. Generally speaking, for large blocks of text, 1.5 times the size of the text is a good  size. Smaller text should have tighter leading, and huge text should have a lot. It&apos;s not that complicated, really.</p>\n<div class=\"tutorial_image\"><img src=\"http://d3pr5r64n04s3o.cloudfront.net/001_FontSelection/5.jpg\" /></div>\n<h3>Tracking</h3>\n<p>Tracking is the space between characters in text. I&apos;ll admit, this one&apos;s a bit of a grey area when it comes to &ldquo;Practical Typography,&rdquo; in that CSS doesn&apos;t give us huge control over it. Usually, you won&apos;t have to worry about it for small text, it&apos;s only for titles that it becomes an issue. Generally speaking, adding <em>letter-spacing: 1px;</em> or <em>letter-spacing: 2px;</em> to your CSS should be enough space between the letters.</p>\n<p>Another place it would be beneficial to add tracking to is small-caps. Here it&apos;s generally considered good practice to add an extra pixel or two between the characters, as they naturally appear larger.</p>\n<div class=\"tutorial_image\"><img src=\"http://d3pr5r64n04s3o.cloudfront.net/001_FontSelection/6.jpg\" /></div>\n<h3>Color</h3>\n<p>While not strictly-speaking typography, color is a very important part of every website&apos;s type. I&apos;m not talking about <em>color schemes</em>, but rather about the contrast needed to insure readability on your site. Black text on a white background (or light background) is widely considered to be the most readable color for text. </p>\n<p>I&apos;m not saying you should go and set everything to black-on-white, just that when you&apos;re designing, you should be aware of the contrast of your text. It could come back to bite you if you&apos;re not careful.</p>\n<div class=\"tutorial_image\"><img src=\"http://d3pr5r64n04s3o.cloudfront.net/001_FontSelection/7.jpg\" /></div>\n<h3>The Grid</h3>\n<p>In my opinion, use of the grid is the most important idea for practical typography on the web. You can have great fonts, spacing, and colors, but if you don&apos;t have a good layout, you may as well be using comic sans.</p>\n<p>Using a grid when you&apos;re designing with type provides a clear balance and geometric structure to your design. It isn&apos;t the magic fix to a bad design, but if you design with a grid from the start, you can be sure that at the very least, your layout will be solid.</p>\n<p>So what does a grid have to do with typography? Put simply: <em>everything</em>. The grid embodies all the fundamental ideals of typography. It&apos;s geometric, consistent, usable, and above all: <em>beautiful</em>.</p>\n<p>Setting your text with a grid is a key way of establishing visual hierarchy, and it&apos;s a great indicator of how large (or small) your text should be.</p>\n<div class=\"tutorial_image\"><img src=\"http://d3pr5r64n04s3o.cloudfront.net/001_FontSelection/8.jpg\" /></div>\n<hr />\n<h2>Standing Out</h2>\n<p>As I said before, if you&apos;re typography is readable, then you&apos;re already ahead of 50% of the competition, so what about the other half? If you&apos;ve made it this far, then together we leave the clear, consistent rules of readability and enter the murky and mysterious world of being unique.</p>\n<h3>Fonts</h3>\n<p>You want your website to stand out? Step 1. Employ some unique typography. Presumably for you this means to use some unique fonts. But what makes a unique font? For me, it&apos;s not one that isn&apos;t used often, but one that has a message or feeling not employed by other faces.</p>\n<p>Choosing a unique font is really about the <em>feeling</em>. Does this font <em>feel</em> different? Or does it just look different? When choosing typefaces for any projects, you should always be considering the feeling of the design. As this is totally a personal opinion, I can&apos;t help you find a unique typeface. What I can do is show an example of unique fonts.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thedesigncubicle.com/\">The Design Cubicle</a> has a very unique logo and design. It&apos;s strong yet classy, attention-grabbing yet subtle. When I look at its design, the feeling of class just oozes out of the site. It says, &ldquo;I know what I&apos;m doing.&rdquo;</p>\n<div class=\"tutorial_image\"><img src=\"http://d3pr5r64n04s3o.cloudfront.net/001_FontSelection/9.jpg\" /></div>\n<h3>Be Unorthodox</h3>\n<p>How many websites do you know whose logo is as big as the content? What about an ultra-thin title? Unlike my last point, being unorthodox is about seeing what others are doing, and then doing the opposite.</p>\n<p>The folks at <a href=\"http://savvybelfast.com/\">Savvy Belfast</a> are smart. They noticed the cramped look of most websites, and decided to replace all that meaningless copy with one statement.</p>\n<div class=\"tutorial_image\"><img src=\"http://d3pr5r64n04s3o.cloudfront.net/001_FontSelection/10.jpg\" /></div>\n<p>Even if you visit their site for only a moment, you can&apos;t help but remember their name.</p>\n<h3>Match Your Design</h3>\n<p>Typography is not it&apos;s own thing. It&apos;s a part of web design just like any other. Type is important, yes, but you shouldn&apos;t forget that is is just part of what makes a web design great. You should design your type with the rest of your design in mind.</p>\n<p>If you use a highly elaborate background texture, then maybe a nice serif would be good for your titles.</p>\n<p>My point here is simple: Don&apos;t forget the <em>context</em>. Design is a huge field, and today I&apos;m just talking about one part of it. For a successful website design, all the parts have to mesh together successful. That&apos;s the goal: to craft the experience that somebody will have on your website. You can&apos;t do that with <em>just type</em>, or <em>just color</em>, or even <em>just content</em>!</p>\n<div class=\"tutorial_image\"><img src=\"http://d3pr5r64n04s3o.cloudfront.net/001_FontSelection/11.jpg\" /></div>\n<h3>Emotional Type</h3>\n<p>So much of an experience is defined by how you feel: happy, sad, amused, angry, blah blah blah. Humans have a wide range of emotions, and as designers, it&apos;s our job to evoke these emotions with our designs.</p>\n<p>Of all the things I&apos;ve talked about today, this is by far the most abstract, and it&apos;s a little hard to explain. Instead of trying to explain this to you, let me show you.</p>\n<p>When I first visited <a href=\"http://solidgiant.com/\">Solid Giant</a>, I smiled. I smiled the next time I saw it, and even the next time. Immediately I felt a kinship towards the design. That big, fuzzy &ldquo;G&rdquo; is just too adorable to forget!</p>\n<div class=\"tutorial_image\"><img src=\"http://d3pr5r64n04s3o.cloudfront.net/001_FontSelection/12.jpg\" /></div>\n<p>Quite frankly, I think it&apos;s genius.</p>\n<p>There&apos;s no way to teach emotional design, it&apos;s something you have to experience, and then play with in your own designs.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Practical Typography</h2>\n<p>Well, you&apos;ve reached the end of the post. I hope that at the very least you&apos;ve learned something, but if not, that&apos;s fine too. If there&apos;s one think I want to leave you with after reading this, it&apos;s that above all: <em>be readable</em>. The rest will follow.</p>\n<p>What do you think the most important part of typography on the web is?

As we go through this tutorial, we&#8217;ll work with: Simple shapes (rectangles, lines, arrows, etc), layer styles (lots of them actually!), layer masks, patterns, character and paragraph styles, and so many other design and Photoshop techniques that you can adapt to your Website interface design workflow.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-24\"></span></p>\n<hr />\n<h2>The Development Part</h2>\n<p>Stay tuned to our sister site <a href=\"http://net.tutsplus.com\">Nettuts+</a>, where we&#8217;ll be building this design into HTML and CSS.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Tutorial Details</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Program</strong>: Adobe Photoshop</li>\n<li><strong>Version</strong>: CS3 (or higher)</li>\n<li><strong>Difficulty</strong>: Intermediate</li>\n<li><strong>Estimated Completion Time</strong>: 3-5 hours</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h2>Step 1</h2>\n<p>To keep everything aligned we&#8217;re going to use 960s Grid System (Get it from <a href=\"http://960.gs/\">here</a>). Once downloaded, open up the file &#8220;960_grid_24_col.psd&#8221;.<br />\nThe height of the current document is smaller than our final design. So, we&#8217;ll go to Image &gt; Canvas Size &gt; Height: 1820px, Anchor: Top center.</p>\n<div class=\"tutorial_image\"><img src=\"http://d3pr5r64n04s3o.cloudfront.net/002_Tut_WarmDesign/1a.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" /></div>\n<p>We also need to make sure that our Rulers and Guides are viewed. So, we&#8217;ll go to View &gt; Extras / Rulers / Snap (so that our objects snap in alignment with our Guides).</p>\n<div class=\"tutorial_image\"><img src=\"http://d3pr5r64n04s3o.cloudfront.net/002_Tut_WarmDesign/1b.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" /></div>\n<p>Let&#8217;s fill our background with a sloid color. Select the layer “Background,” right-click on it, and choose: Layer from background, and give it a meaningful name (for example: “bg”).<br />\nNow, using the Rectangular Marquee Tool (M), create a selection over the whole canvas, set your foreground color to: #f8eedf, then click Shift+Backspace to fill your selection.</p>\n<div class=\"tutorial_image\"><img src=\"http://d3pr5r64n04s3o.cloudfront.net/002_Tut_WarmDesign/1c.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" /></div>\n<hr />\n<h2>Step 2</h2>\n<p>Let&#8217;s start creating our header. Using the Rectangular Marquee Tool (M), or the Rectangle Tool (U) (or whatever tool you prefer to use), create a rectangle / selection of 1020x100px and fill it with any color just for now.</p>\n<div class=\"tutorial_image\"><img src=\"http://d3pr5r64n04s3o.cloudfront.net/002_Tut_WarmDesign/2a.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" /></div>\n<p>Go ahead and apply a Gradient Overlay to your header, by right-clicking on our layer &gt; Blending Options &gt; Gradient Overlay &gt; use the image below as a reference:</p>\n<div class=\"tutorial_image\"><img src=\"http://d3pr5r64n04s3o.cloudfront.net/002_Tut_WarmDesign/2b.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" /></div>\n<p>Now, in order to stop our header background from looking flat, we&#8217;ll apply a simple Noise texture. So, create a new layer (obviously it needs to be above the background layer itself), create a selection over the header background, and then fill it (by clicking  Shift+Backspace) with this color value: #ffc05e.</p>\n<div class=\"tutorial_image\"><img src=\"http://d3pr5r64n04s3o.cloudfront.net/002_Tut_WarmDesign/2c.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" /></div>\n<p>Go to Filter &gt; Noise &gt; Add Noise &gt; Amount: 48px, Distribution: Gaussian.

Using the Line Tool (U), create two lines each of them should be 1x60px, fill the one on the left with this color value: #ffd593, and the one on the right with this color value: #c08c3a.<br />\nAlso, make sure to leave 20px of horizontal white space between the two lines and the four icons.</p>\n<div class=\"tutorial_image\"><img src=\"http://d3pr5r64n04s3o.cloudfront.net/002_Tut_WarmDesign/4c.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" /></div>\n<p>Select the Gradient Tool (G), open up the Gradient Editor dialogue box, set your gradient settings according to the image below.<br />\nThen, right-click on the layer of one of the lines we just created, choose: Add layer mask.</p>\n<div class=\"tutorial_image\"><img src=\"http://d3pr5r64n04s3o.cloudfront.net/002_Tut_WarmDesign/4d.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" /></div>\n<p>Drag with the Gradient Tool (G) from top to bottom. Do the same with the layer of the other line (or, you can just copy the layer mask and paste it in the other layer).</p>\n<div class=\"tutorial_image\"><img src=\"http://d3pr5r64n04s3o.cloudfront.net/002_Tut_WarmDesign/4e.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" /></div>\n<hr />\n<h2>Step 5</h2>\n<p>It&#8217;s time to start working on the navigation bar. Select the Rectangular Marquee Tool (M), create a selection of 1020x600px, and fill it with this color value: #40312a.</p>\n<div class=\"tutorial_image\"><img src=\"http://d3pr5r64n04s3o.cloudfront.net/002_Tut_WarmDesign/5a.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" /></div>\n<p>Using the Single Row Marquee Tool, create a 1020x1px, and fill it with this color value: #f9ba59.</p>\n<div class=\"tutorial_image\"><img src=\"http://d3pr5r64n04s3o.cloudfront.net/002_Tut_WarmDesign/5b.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" /></div>\n<p>We&#8217;ll add a highlight by creating a selection of 1020x1px, filling it with this color value: #735a4f, and taking its Opacity down to: 70%.</p>\n<div class=\"tutorial_image\"><img src=\"http://d3pr5r64n04s3o.cloudfront.net/002_Tut_WarmDesign/5c.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" /></div>\n<hr />\n<h2>Step 6</h2>\n<p>In this step, we&#8217;ll create our navigation text.

We&#8217;ll start by typing the word “SEARCH” using the same character settings we&#8217;ve applied to the navigation text, but this time we&#8217;ll change the font weight to: Book. We&#8217;ll also apply to it the same Drop Shadow we&#8217;ve applied to the word “Home”.</p>\n<div class=\"tutorial_image\"><img src=\"http://d3pr5r64n04s3o.cloudfront.net/002_Tut_WarmDesign/7a.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" /></div>\n<p>It&#8217;s time to create the input field. Using the Rounded Rectangle Tool (U), create a 190x25px rectangle, with 3px radius, fill it with this color value: #2c8797, and apply a Layer Style to it, according to the following image:</p>\n<div class=\"tutorial_image\"><img src=\"http://d3pr5r64n04s3o.cloudfront.net/002_Tut_WarmDesign/7b.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" /></div>\n<p>Try finding or creating a very simple magnifying glass icon, place it like in the image below, and don&#8217;t forget to apply the same Drop Shadow we&#8217;ve applied to the word “SEARCH” to this icon.</p>\n<div class=\"tutorial_image\"><img src=\"http://d3pr5r64n04s3o.cloudfront.net/002_Tut_WarmDesign/7c.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" /></div>\n<hr />\n<h2>Step 8</h2>\n<p>Let&#8217;s start working on the featured / welcome area.

Sometimes it seems that in the dizzying world of web design blogs, roundups, and screencasts, people just skim over the part of the process that makes everything else possible.</p>\n<p><strong>This post marks the first in a series where we&#8217;ll be examining the &#8220;planning&#8221; phase in web design.</strong> The goal: to better understand the role that planning plays in design; when it&#8217;s effective, and when it&#8217;s wasted.<span id=\"more-74\"></span></p>\n<hr/ >\n<div class=\"tutorial_image\"><img src=\"http://d3pr5r64n04s3o.cloudfront.net/005_Planning_1/1.jpg\" /></div>\n<h2>Why Plan At All?</h2>\n<p>\nSome web designers feel that planning has become a somewhat irrelevant part of the creative workflow &#8211; <em>&#8220;Why bother planning when I can dig right into the creative phase&#8221;?</em>;  this kind of attitude is great for the designer who doesn&#8217;t mind spending an extra 10 hours on a project for the fun of it, but for others it&#8217;s a waste of time to ignore something so integral to the design process.\n</p>\n<p>\nBefore we really dig in, it&#8217;s probably important to explain what kind of planning I&#8217;m referring to &#8211; I&#8217;m not referring to the type of plan that involves &#8220;guessing&#8221; and falls apart minutes after the project starts. What I am talking about is a plan that will eliminate guesswork, define goals, and establish a solid foundation for you to get creative with. The art of planning is more like a &#8220;brainstorm with a purpose&#8221; than it is a comprehensive technical spec.</p>\n<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s a waste of time to ignore something so integral to the design process</p></blockquote>\n<p>\nPlanning is the formative phase in any project &#8211; it doesn&#8217;t hinder the creative process, it <em>defines</em> it. A good planning session doesn&#8217;t even require a lot of time or energy, but the benefits will last far into the entire duration of the project. A thoughtful approach to planning will help boost your creativity, save you time in the creative process, and make you look like a rockstar to clients!</p>\n<p><div class=\"tutorial_image\"><img src=\"http://d3pr5r64n04s3o.cloudfront.net/005_Planning_1/2.jpg\" /></div>\n<hr />\n<h2>When Should You Plan?</h2>\n<p>\nBefore you even fire up Photoshop or your favorite code-editor. Design Planning is about setting the overall mission of a project, so it&#8217;s important that you define the ultimate goal of the website that you&#8217;re going to be working on <em>before </em>you approach it creatively. Some top level questions you should ask are:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Why will people be visiting the site?</li>\n<li>What function does it serve you or your client?</li>\n<li>What needs to happen for this design to be a success?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nAnswering these questions early on will save time, energy, and money in the long run, but more than anything, it&#8217;ll help you to figure out exactly how your website design is going to rock! Something as simple as spending 15 minutes planning out your ultimate goals can help refine your purpose and make sure that you don&#8217;t miss the bigger picture.\n</p>\n<hr/ >\n<h2>What Should You Plan?</h2>\n<p>\nPlanning is going to be a little different for everyone out there &#8211; some sites are straight forward and require just a few minutes of planning; others are big, complex, and can spend days, weeks and even months in the planning stages. I&#8217;ll be discussing these steps in more depth in future articles, but I can outline about 6 crucial planning steps in any web design project:\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Define Success</li>\n<li>Define the Content</li>\n<li>Define the Features</li>\n<li>Consider the Audience</li>\n<li>Do the Research</li>\n<li>Organization, Hierarchy and the Wireframe</li>\n</ol>\n<hr />\n<h2>What Does Planning Look Like?</h2>\n<p>\nThe actual format of your planning can be anything from an elaborate creative brief document to a sketch on the back of a napkin. Honestly &#8211; use what works for you and don&#8217;t try to force it. If you aren&#8217;t ever going to go back and read an elaborate creative brief, then don&#8217;t bother writing one! The trick is to use a planning format that works for you and your workflow genetics. I happen to love the idea of hands-on notepads; especially those snazzy <a href=\"http://www.creativesoutfitter.com/\">Action Books from Behance</a> &#8211; but realistically, I know that I do my best planning using a simple text-editor app: no frills, no formatting, no distractions. Your planning method is going to look unique to you though &#8211; so take some time to consider what works best for your own personal style.\n</p>\n<blockquote><p>The actual format of your planning can be anything from an elaborate creative brief document to a sketch on the back of a napkin.</p></blockquote>\n<hr />\n<h2>Know the Limitations of Planning</h2>\n<p>\nLet&#8217;s make one thing clear: designing a website is a lot like building something in a vacuum; Try as you might, you won&#8217;t ever be able to plan for every possible outcome when your site hits the web. The likelihood that your design will cover every possible scenario for the next 2-3 years of that site&#8217;s life are slim at best. The site will change, the visitors will change, heck, you or your client will change.\n</p>\n<div class=\"tutorial_image><img src=\"-1.jpg\" /></div>\n<p>\nThe planning stage isn&#8217;t for defining each and every tiny variable, it&#8217;s for painting broad strokes and establishing your overall strategy. Planning each and every detail will ultimately fail because it will force you to make guesses &#8211; and regardless of how educated a guess might be, it&#8217;s still just a guess. Keep your planning focused on the big picture stuff that will stay the same throughout the project.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn this series of articles, I&#8217;ll be introducing some tips, tricks, and other techniques to improve your own planning process. I&#8217;m going to be catering this series towards newer designers, but it&#8217;s my hope that everyone can glean some useful information!</p>\n<p>\n","commentRss":"http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/workflow/planning-ahead-examining-ways-to-improve-your-workflow/feed/"},{"title":"Welcome to Webdesigntuts+!","link":"http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/news/welcome-to-webdesigntuts/","comments":["http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/news/welcome-to-webdesigntuts/#comments","81"],"pubDate":"Mon, 11 Oct 2010 04:37:14 +0000","creator":"Skellie","category":"News","guid":{"isPermaLink":"false","content":"http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/?p=256"},"description":"<p>Today we&#8217;re extremely proud to launch Webdesigntuts+, the 10th member of the <a href=\"http://tutsplus.com\">Tuts+</a> family.
